## A Bit About Thea

(she/her)

I've worked with electricty, computers, controls and projects for money, in parallel with being a perennial student of metaphysics, mysticism, languages and history.

Technology attracted me since it contained a mystery. My unpaid explorations call to me in the same way, with the promise of unravelling Secrets of the Universe, and maybe being able to, one day, create something unforgettable and wonderful.
