##This is Under Construction
###But Still of Some Value

I am a person who worked in tech for my career, in parallel with being a student of metaphysics, mysticism and history.

Tech attracted me since in is a series of mysteries to the uninitiated, and once unraveled is useful. I've always liked ot build things and improve them. My parellel track attracted me for the same way, witht he promise of revealing the Secret of the Universe, and potentially creating something unforgettable.
