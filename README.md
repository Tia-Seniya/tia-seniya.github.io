I am a person who worked in tech for my career, in parallel with being a student of metaphysics, mysticism and history.

Tech attracted me since in is a series of mysteries to the uninitiated, and once unraveled is useful. I've always liked ot build things and improve them. My parellel track attracted me in the same way, with the promise of unravelling the Secret of the Universe, and creating something unforgettable, and possibly wonderful.
