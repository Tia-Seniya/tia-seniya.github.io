## A Bit About Thea

My name is Thea Seniya and I am a retired tecchie, originally from south central Canada. I received my technical education in engineering via the military, College and University in Canada. I worked in quality assurance and engineering for a multinational for about 20 years, then for about the same at a nuke plant at which I had protested when its ground was first broken. After an extended quest to improve the things provided by suppliers to the power station, I took early retirement in order to seek a return to sanity.

I moved to Maritime Canada in 2017 with my partner and settled near Halifax, then we unsettled to a remote location by the sea, and 3 years ago, to another oceanside place, a bit closer to amenities
 I am an autodidact with a fascination with the esoteric. My interests include the anthropology of Asia, and the systems of spiritual  development that evolved in those regions; in the study of religion, magic, witchcraft, and neo-shamanism(s).

I like history, megalithic sites, ancient ruins, folklore, geo-political current events, Vedic astrology, personality revelation systems (MBTI, Human Design, etc), yogas, alternative healing modalities, divination, spirits (fermented and disembodied), languages, feng shui, design, sculpture, cooking, organic gardening (incl permaculture & food forest creation).  I’ve been fortunate to have been able to travel to parts of Britain, the USA, Beijing, central Tibet, Polynesia, New Zealand and Fukushima Japan.

My unpaid explorations call to me in the same way as technology did, a long time ago, with the promise of unravelling Secrets, and maybe being able to, one day, create something unforgettable and wonderful.
